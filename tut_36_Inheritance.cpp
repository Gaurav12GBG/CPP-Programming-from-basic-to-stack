/* 
INHERITANCE :- The concept of reusability in OOP is supported using inheritance
             - We can reuse the properties of existing class by inheriting from it.
             - The existing class is called Base class.
             - The new class which is inherited is called Derived class.
             - Reusing the classes saves time and money.
             - There are different type of inheritance in cpp.

FORMS OF INHERITANCE :- Single Inheritance
                      - Multiple Inheritance
                      - Multilevel Inheritance
                      - Hierarchical Inheritance
                      - Hybrid Inheritance

                      - Single Inheritance :- A derived class with only one base class.
                                                   A(base) -----> B(derived)

                      - Multiple Inheritance :- A derived class with more than one base class.
                                                A(base) , B(base) -----> C)derived

                      - Hiearchical Inheritance :- Several derived classes from one base class.
                                                        A(base) ---> B(derived), C(derived)

                      - Multilevel Inheritance :- Deriving a class from already derived class.
                                                    A(base) ---> B(derived) ---> C(derived from B)
